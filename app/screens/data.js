    question: "Does climate change affect the transmission of coronavirus?",
    answer:
      "Although there is no direct evidence linking climate changessd to the spread of COVID-19, it has been hypothesized that its effects on our health and the risk for infections are real. As the Earth warms, many animals are traveling to the poles to escape the heat. This phenomenon has the potential to introduce pathogens to new hosts. Climate change is considered one of the main factors that increases the risk of pandemics. Habitat loss increases the frequency of infectious diseases among animals and humans.",
